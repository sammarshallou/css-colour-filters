I took the colour code from an [existing solution](https://github.com/angel-rs/css-color-filter-generator) but wrote a new solver to get the colour.

With the existing one I didn't like the way you had to rerun it to get the right answer. This one gives you the right answer straight away.

[Use the generator on GitHub pages](https://sammarshallou.github.io/css-colour-filters)

No doubt there are other things wrong with it :)
