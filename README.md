I took the colour code from an (existing solution)[https://github.com/angel-rs/css-color-filter-generator] but wrote a new solver to get the colour.

With the existing one I didn't like the way you had to rerun it to get the right answer. This one gives you the right answer straight away.

No doubt there are other things wrong with it :)
